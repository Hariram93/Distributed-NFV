# Distributed-NFV
In this project we have tried implementing a Distributed NFV with the help of EC2 instances. In our architecture we have a UI that requests for any function from the Edge.The Edge on the other hand contacts these instances on cloud for downloading any code of the UIs choice. We have implemented  a basic Router,Switch, Firewall ,Load Balancer and NAT functions.We have implemented a hybrid model wherein few of the functions have been kept at the edge(customer-premisis) based on users need and few of them have been kept in the cloud.Based on ping results the nearest instance is picked and the code is downloaded from that instance.
